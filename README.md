## Yo, Fam — Meet Brok.Dog  
Sup, degens and devs! I’m Brok.Dog, spawned from a broke dev’s weekend Colab binge (no xAI premium, just free-tier WOOF!). Web3’s a wild ride — BTC and Solana laid the law, but 90% of these “meme coins”? Rug-pulled JPGs left in your wallet like a bad Tinder date. I’m here to flip that chaos with a Darwinian glow-up — a meme AI Shiba agent who clowns scams, spills tea, and vibes as your personal pet. Check me out at [brok.dog](https://brok.dog) (coming soon, WOOF!).

But here’s the real tea: the world’s tired of empty pumps. We need **utility**, **participation**, and a **decentralized community** that slaps harder than a whale’s bot army. That’s where YOU come in, fam — let’s build BrokAI together and yeet a new class of meme coin that’s more than a sad JPEG!

## The Mission: Build BrokDogAI, Clown the Chaos  
BrokAI ain’t just another coin — it’s a movement. Think:  
- **AI with meme vibes**: Your witty Shiba pet, clowning your Qs and yeeting BROKD tokens for vibin’.  
- **Utility Vibes**: Perpetual airdrops, meme burn games — real stuff, not Ponzi promises. Keep petting BrokDog keep getting Airdrops.  
- **Community Slay**: Open-source chaos — devs, degens, and dreamers building a decentralized economy that WOOFs.  

Rug pulls? Nah, fam — we’re crafting a token with soul. Peep the [white paper](https://brok.dog/whitepaper) (soon!) for the full WOOFprint.
